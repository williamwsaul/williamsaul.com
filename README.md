# William Saul - Personal Website
## Written with HTML, CSS, & JavaScript

This is a website to host my compositions and other related materials. I submitted this as my final
project for an introductory coding class in 2023. Please contact me here: https://williamsaul.com/contact

### Project Objectives:
* Host mp3s, images, pdfs, and text.
* Create an aesthetically compelling experience for users.
* Provide contact information with minimal spam-botting.

### Potential Issues:
* Embedded Tweets don't load with Brave sheilds/ad blocking.

Much appreciated,

William
