# William Saul - Personal Website
## Written with HTML, CSS, & JavaScript

This is a website to host my compositions and other related materials. I submitted this as my final
project for an introductory coding class in 2023. I am a novice in computer programming, but my objectives are 
simple. Please contact me here: https://williamwsaul.github.io/williamsaul.com/contact.html

### Project Objectives:
* Host mp3s, images, pdfs, and text.
* Create an aesthetically compelling experience for users.
* Provide contact information with minimal spam-botting.
* Embed Twitter essays onto research page.

### Potential Issues:
* Not scaled for mobile devices yet - currently unusable.
* Implimented encrypted pdf workaround instead of contact form.
* Embedded Tweets don't load with Brave sheilds/ad blocking.

Much appreciated,

William
